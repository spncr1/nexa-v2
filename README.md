# NEXA - Student Workload Management Tool

A student-focused academic planning web application designed to help manage assignments, tasks, and study workload in one clear interface.

I built Nexa to solve a problem I repeatedly faced as a student: academic work often becomes scattered across separate tools, making it harder to see what is due, what needs attention, and how to plan work effectively. Nexa brings assignment tracking, task management, calendar-based planning, and study session organisation into a focused academic workflow.

The project was built as a full-stack personal software project, with an emphasis on practical usability, clean interface design, and structured academic planning.

## Running the Project

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spncr1/nexa-v2.git
cd nexa-v2
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root. For local development, provide either a `DATABASE_URL` or the individual PostgreSQL values:

```env
SESSION_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-string
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

PGHOST=localhost
PGPORT=5432
PGUSER=your_postgres_user
PGPASSWORD=your_postgres_password
PGDATABASE=nexa_v1
```

Email verification, password reset, and reminder emails also need SMTP values:

```env
SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your_smtp_username
SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_password
MAIL_FROM="Nexa <no-reply@example.com>"
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the local URL shown in the terminal:

```bash
http://localhost:3000/login
```

The app checks the PostgreSQL connection and runs pending database migrations on startup.
